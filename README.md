# Secure File Sharing System (FastAPI)

A secure file-sharing REST API built using **FastAPI** that allows two types of users **Ops** and **Client** to interact with files securely. This includes file uploads (restricted to certain types), email verification, login, and secure downloads using encrypted links.

---

## Features

### Ops User

- Login
- Upload files (`.pptx`, `.docx`, `.xlsx` only)

### Client User

- Sign Up (returns an encrypted verification URL)
- Email verification
- Login
- List uploaded files
- Download files via secure encrypted link

---

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** - Web framework
- **SQLite** - Lightweight database (can be swapped with PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **Passlib + Bcrypt** - Password hashing
- **Pythonâ€™s `cryptography`** - For encrypted download URLs
- **Pytest + HTTPX** - Unit testing

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khushipy/secure-file-sharing-api.git
cd secure-file-sharing-api
```

2. **Create virtual environment and activate**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Start the FastAPI server**

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

5. **Visit Docs**

```

```

## Upload & Download Flow

- Ops user uploads a file via `/upload` (only if authenticated).
- Client user signs up and gets a simulated email with verification link.
- Once verified and logged in, client can:
  - List files via `/files`
  - Request download via `/download-file/{file_id}` â†’ returns encrypted download URL.
  - Download via `/access-file/{encrypted_url}`

---

##  Unit Tests

We use **`pytest`** with **`httpx.AsyncClient`** to simulate endpoints.

### Run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

 Includes test coverage for:

- Auth (sign up, login)
- Upload (ops-only)
- Download (client-only with encrypted URL)

##  Deployment Plan

Though this is a local system, here's how you can deploy it in production:

1. Use **Gunicorn** + **Uvicorn workers**
2. Set up **PostgreSQL** or another production-grade DB
3. Serve with **Nginx** as reverse proxy
4. Add **HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)** for secure transfer
5. Use **Docker** or services like **Render/Heroku** for containerized deployment
6. Enable **logging, monitoring**, and **environment variables**

## Security Highlights

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Emails must be verified before login
- Download links are encrypted and access-controlled
- Only specific file types are allowed for upload
